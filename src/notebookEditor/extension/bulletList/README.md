# BulletList

This extension enables rendering of bullet lists in the editor.

They are rendered as 'ul' HTML tags.

Typing '*', '-' or '+' at the beginning of a new line will transform
it into a bullet list. They can also be triggered
by the Ctrl/CMD + Shift + 8 keyboard shortcut.

The content of a Bullet List is a set of List Items (SEE: ListItem.ts)
