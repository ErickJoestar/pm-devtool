# Rectangle

A rectangle is represented by an HTML rect element. This rectangle can only exist
within an SVG node. The rectangle can be dragged by the user.

Interaction with the rectangle is entirely managed by the SVGNode NodeView, and the
rectangle's rendering behavior its entirely its responsibility.

The user can add as many rectangles as pleased to a single SVGNode.

A use can copy, cut and paste rectangles across different SVGNodes.
