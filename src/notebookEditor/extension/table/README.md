# Table

This extension allows the insertion of a TableNode into the editor.

The table is comprised of rows and columns, both of which are comprised
of cells. Cells can be merged, split, or turned into headers.

The table can be deleted, rows and columns can be added or removed, and headers
can be toggled for rows, columns or cells. The table is deleted if all of its
cells are selected and the user backspaces, or if the delete table button is
clicked on the toolbar. This might change in the future.

The user can perform the previously mentioned actions by
interacting with the toolbar.
