# Header

Tables can have headers for each column, row, or for many columns/rows.

They are differentiated from regular cells by having a specific color and
having the text inside of them set to bold. Other than that, they are
regular cells (and hence, the same commands that can be applied to a cell
can be applied to a header).

Table headers are defined with th elements, each th element representing
a table cell.
