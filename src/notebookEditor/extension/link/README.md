# Link

The Link extension adds support for 'a' tags to the editor. Pasted URLs get
transformed into links automatically, as well as text that is typed by the
user when it is a link.

The user can add a link through the Ctrl / Cmd + K keyboard shortcut, which
will cause a Dialog to appear asking the user for the link's href attribute.
